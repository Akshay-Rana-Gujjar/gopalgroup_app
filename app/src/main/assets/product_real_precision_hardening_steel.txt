Laxcon specializes into the production of 17-4 PH, 15-5 PH & 17-7 PH steels (also known as 1.4542 and AISI 630).
The precipitation hardening (PH) stainless steel grade is a family of corrosion resistant alloys that provide hardness upto three or four times that of an austenitic stainless steel such as type 304 or type 316.

They are used in the oil and gas, nuclear and aerospace industries where a combination of high strength, corrosion resistance and degree of toughness is required. Precipitation hardening is achieved by adding copper, molybdenum, aluminium and titanium either individually or in combination.
