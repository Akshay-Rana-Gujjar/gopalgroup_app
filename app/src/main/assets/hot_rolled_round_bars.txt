Hot rolled bars for applications that need the properties of stainless steel without the cold finishing or brignt supply condition
Hot rolled round bars are generally used in the applications like construction, where finish and precise dimensions aren't a priority. They go through various heat treatment processes such as soft annealing, solution annealing, spheroidized annealing, oil & water quenching, tempering and normalizing. They are essential in fabrication, manufacturing and repair.
