Billets and blooms in hot rolled finish used pre-dominantly by forging and rolling mill companies
Continuous casting of steel is a process in which liquid steel is continuously solidified into a strand of metal. Depending on the dimensions of the strand, these semi-finished products are called slabs, blooms or billets. It is a feed material for rolling of steel in light section mills, bar mills, and wire rod mills. Steel billets are used in forging of certain products as well as re-rolling, hot forging and ring rolling applications.
