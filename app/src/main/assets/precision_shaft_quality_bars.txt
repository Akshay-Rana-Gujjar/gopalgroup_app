Stainless steel precision bars for applications that require the highest level of machinability and ovality
Due to the high resistance to corrosion, machinability and high strength, precision quality bars are generally used in pump shafts, piston shafts, cylinder shafts, valve shafts, boat shafts, bearing bars etc. To add strength, toughness and other material properties they go through soft annealing, solution annealing, quenching, and tempering.
